## Advent of Code 2024

This year I will be attempting Advent of Code in **Python**. As always, I am optimising my process for maximum fun and enjoyment, not impressive code. I like to solve the puzzles relatively quickly but will often go back and improve upon a solution once I have the correct answer.

### Daily Setup
Each day I run `.\day.ps1` which is a PowerShell script that sets up a folder for that day's work, and pulls the input file from the website. It uses the current day of the month, so I have to make sure I get round to it on the day! It copies a template Python file, and some empty text files for adding test input.

### Day summary
- **Day 1:** Comparing two lists of integers side-by-side
- Day 2: Integer sequences increasing or decreasing like `4 5 8 7 12`
- Day 3: Regex to find valid function calls like `mul(5,32)`
- Day 4: Wordsearch to find all occurrences of `XMAS` or `X-MAS`
- Day 5: Re-ordering pages of a book based on rules like `97|13`
- Day 6: Tracing a guard moving in a 2D map to see if he leaves or forms a loop
- **Day 7:** Budget "Countdown" - Placing operators between each pair of numbers in a list to see if you can make the total e.g. `190 = 10 * 19`
- **Day 8:** Extrapolating lines between antennae to find 'antinodes'
- Day 9: Disk fragmentation and defragmentation with lists like `0..11...2222`
- Day 10: Finding hiking trails from 0 to 9 with smooth inclines
- Day 11: Count the numbers on some magical stones that are renumbering themselves each time you blink
