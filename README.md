## Advent of Code 2024

This year I will be attempting Advent of Code in **Python**. As always, I am optimising my process for maximum fun and enjoyment, not impressive code. I like to solve the puzzles relatively quickly but will often go back and improve upon a solution once I have the correct answer.

### Daily Setup
Each day I run `.\day.ps1` which is a PowerShell script that sets up a folder for that day's work. It uses the current day of the month, so I have to make sure I get round to it on the day! It copies a template Python file, and some empty text files for my puzzle input and the test input.
